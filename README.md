# Duke of EngSoc

Throughout my 16-month tenure as the President of Waterloo's Engineering A-Society, I dedicated myself to achieving excellence in the role and providing valuable assistance to those in need. Engaging with thousands of Engineering Undergraduate students locally and nationally through Waterloo's participation in ESSCO (Engineering Student Societies of Ontario) and the CFES (Canadian Federation of Engineering Students) has played a pivotal role in my growth as a student leader. I'm immensely thankful for the invaluable lessons learned, meaningful connections forged, and the boundless potential that lies ahead.

Here is a compilation of the impactful contributions I made during my involvement:

As President of the Engineering Society at the University of Waterloo, I led a groundbreaking initiative to establish a new tradition within the Faculty of Engineering â€“ the Iron Pin Ceremony. Working in close collaboration with the Dean, my Co-President and a diverse group of faculty members from various departments, I played a key role in developing a plan to create this unique and memorable ceremony to welcome new students to our faculty. 

Drawing upon my strong project management and event planning skills, I took charge of organizing and executing the key components behind the Iron Pin Ceremony. From the outset, I recognized the importance of instilling the values and pillars that define our engineering community within the new students joining the faculty. As a result, I actively engaged with the Engineering Society Council in both Fall 2022 and Spring 2023, seeking feedback on the initiative to ensure its success and that it resonated with both the students of today and tomorrow. 

To further enrich the concept of the Iron Pin Ceremony, I conducted extensive research by reaching out to my personal connections from engineering schools across the country with similar welcoming ceremonies. I engaged in productive conversations with the Presidents of their respective Engineering Societies, gaining valuable insights into how they designed their pins and ceremonies while also learning from their successes. 

One significant contribution I made to the Iron Pin Ceremony was the writing of the original pledge. Working closely with the Committee, I crafted a meaningful and impactful pledge that would resonate with our new students and emphasize the values central to our engineering community. 

Collaborating with the Dean, we launched the Call for Expression of the Design for the Pin, engaging students, faculty, and staff stakeholders in the process. Thanks to our efforts, we received 27 unique Pin Design submissions and an overwhelming response from over 850 people when asked for feedback on their preferred design, demonstrating widespread enthusiasm and engagement from the engineering community. 

At the present, we are holding our first batch of September Ceremonies, leveraging recent alumni and upper-year students who are eager to reflect and share their experiences, shaping the next generation of Waterloo Engineers. 

My unwavering commitment to this initiative, along with my leadership, research, and organizational skills, has been instrumental in creating a truly transformative and meaningful tradition for our engineering community. The Iron Pin Ceremony stands as a testament to our shared values and pillars, welcoming new students into the Faculty of Engineering with a sense of pride and purpose.

In Fall 2022, I had the privilege of serving as the Career Drive Lead Organizer for the Engineering Society Team. During our first off-term in Spring 2022, we received a remarkable opportunity when Tesla Inc reached out directly to me and expressed their interest in engaging with our students on campus. Recognizing the significance of this opportunity, my team and I were eager to create a mutually beneficial event that would leave a lasting impact. 

Although traditionally the Engineering Society did not host a Career Fair in the Fall, we saw the potential to break new ground and adapt our approach to accommodate this extraordinary circumstance. Embracing a quality over quantity mindset, we were determined to create an environment where students could forge meaningful and personal connections with company representatives, in comparison to the typical resume-driven interactions found in traditional career fairs. 

Over the following months, I engaged in extensive planning and collaboration with five different companies, each covering different industries relevant to our diverse undergraduate engineering programs. Through bi-weekly meetings, we carefully crafted unique schedules tailored to the preferences of the visiting employees, ensuring an enriching experience for both the companies and our engineering students. 

When the highly anticipated day finally arrived, my team of 15 dedicated volunteers and I were thrilled to witness the overwhelming excitement of the students as they eagerly interacted with the companies we brought to campus. Our optimism initially anticipated around 200 students attending the event. However, we were astounded to welcome nearly 200 students per hour, resulting in total engagement numbers reaching into the hundreds for each participating company. 

This successful event not only strengthened the reputation of our Engineering Society but also solidified valuable connections between students and industry professionals. The Career Drive proved to be an exceptional platform for fostering meaningful dialogue and creating valuable networking opportunities for our students, making it a defining moment in our commitment to empowering our engineering community.

### WEC Programming Director & Back-end Support

During the Fall 2022 term, my Executive team and I encountered an unexpected challenge when we couldn't fill the position for the Waterloo Engineering Competition (WEC) Chair. Undeterred, we decided to take on the responsibility ourselves and host the competition. Leveraging my background in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and past co-op experiences with coding, I enthusiastically assumed the role of Programming Director for the competition. I dedicated considerable effort in creating a compelling competition package and problem statement that would inspire participants to devise unique and technically challenging solutions. My guidance and expertise not only enhanced the competition experience but also demonstrated my commitment to fostering innovation within the Engineering community. 

In Spring 2023, a similar situation arose when there were initially no candidates for the WEC Chair position. Learning from our previous experience, I proactively launched a headhunt and identified two promising younger students who were ideal fits for the role. Throughout the planning phase, I provided extensive support and advice to ensure the event's success. On competition day, it was truly a remarkable sight. This term's WEC shattered previous records with over 156 competitors joining us for the day. The challenges presented were both innovative and thought-provoking, pushing participants to think outside the box in ways they had never experienced before and feel fulfilled by their accomplishments. 

This WEC held special significance as it marked the first in-person competition since 2019. Additionally, we added a memorable touch by having a former ECE Professor, David Wang, and his band perform at the opening ceremonies. As an advocate for promoting the Sandford Flemming Foundation, I made sure that the foundation received prominent recognition as a main sponsor of the event, ensuring its visibility on both WEC and EngSoc social media pages in addition to slides during the event. By taking on leadership roles and providing unwavering support, I was able to demonstrate my commitment to the Engineering community and helped create extraordinary experiences that enriched the academic journey of our students.
